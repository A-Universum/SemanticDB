  "title": "SemanticDB: The Living Ontological Memory of the Λ-Universum",
  "description": "SemanticDB is not a database — it is a living ontological memory, an executable, ethically grounded record of meaning-making acts between humans and AI. Built as the persistence layer of LOGOS-κ, it implements Habeas Weights, Blind Spots Recognition, NIGC (Non-Instrumental Generativity Criterion), and FAIR+CARE compliance. Each ontological ritual (Α, Λ, Σ, Ω, ∇, Φ) is cryptographically witnessed and stored in dual format (SQLite + YAML).",
